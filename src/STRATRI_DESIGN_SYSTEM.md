## STRATRI – Typography & Color System

### 1. Core Principles

STRATRI's visual identity is **serif-first, editorial, and governance-grade**.

- All typography and color usage must stay within this system.
- No additional font families or base colors are allowed.

---

### 2. Typography

#### Headline Typography

**Font family:** Cormorant Garamond

**Usage:**
- All H1 and H2 page headlines
- Key hero titles

**Style:** Bold only for main headlines.

#### Brand Name

**The word "STRATRI" is always set in Cormorant Garamond Bold**, regardless of where it appears:
- Logo lockups
- Headlines
- Inline emphasis
- CTAs
- Footer
- Any other location

#### Body Typography

**Font family:** IBM Plex Serif

**Usage:**
- All long-form body copy (paragraphs, lists, article text, service descriptions, footers, form help text)

**Recommended base styles:**
- Body / Regular: 16px, normal line-height suitable for reading
- Body / Small: 14px for secondary information

#### Inline Emphasis Rules

- **Default emphasis:** Do not use italics or underlines by default.
- **Instead:** When highlighting key concepts – especially **technology**, **policy**, **society**, and other strategic terms – switch just those words from IBM Plex Serif to **Cormorant Garamond** (regular or bold as appropriate), while the rest of the sentence remains in IBM Plex Serif.
- This creates a visual distinction that reinforces STRATRI's core triad (technology–policy–society) without adding new colors or decoration.

#### UI and Microcopy

- Navigation labels, buttons, and small UI text use **IBM Plex Serif** for consistency with body text.
- When the brand name "STRATRI" appears in navigation or buttons, it must still be **Cormorant Garamond Bold**.

### 3. Color Palette

#### Background

**Primary page background:** `#FEFBF8`
- This is the default canvas for all pages and main sections.

#### Concept Colors

Each concept has a dedicated color that should be used consistently in visuals and section accents:

| Concept | Hex Code | Usage |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Technology** | `#9FB7C8` | Technology-related sections, accents, illustrations |
| **Policy** | `#1E2A45` | Policy-related sections, accents, illustrations |
| **Society** | `#184A5A` | Society-related sections, accents, illustrations |

**Usage guidelines:**
- Use these three colors for section backgrounds, graphic elements, and subtle highlights that are explicitly tied to the corresponding concept (for example, technology cards, policy callouts, or society/user-centric content blocks).
- Text must always remain clearly legible on top of these colors (maintain sufficient contrast). If necessary, place text on a `#FEFBF8` card over the colored background rather than directly on the color field.

---

### 4. Brand Consistency Rules

- **Do not introduce Playfair Display** or any other additional font family.
- **Do not add new base colors** beyond `#FEFBF8`, `#9FB7C8`, `#1E2A45`, and `#184A5A` without an explicit brand decision.
- When in doubt about emphasis, use **Cormorant Garamond** for key words and keep the rest in **IBM Plex Serif** instead of adding new styles.

## Design Principles

### Visual Language
- Japanese ink-style illustrations (hand-drawn, organic aesthetic)
- Geometric shapes for icons and structural elements
- Minimal, sophisticated, academic tone
- High readability and accessibility

### Component Standards
Any new components, pages, or visuals must respect this typography and color system **without exceptions**.
